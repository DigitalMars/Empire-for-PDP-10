This is the last PDP-10 version that I made. The file dates are
screwed up because they were downloaded from the Caltech PDP-10
via phone to a PDP-11 in
1979, and downloaded again from my H11 to my Club AT via RS-232C
cable (I don't have 8" disk drives on my AT!).

The copyright notice is in 15.FOR (I know, terrible file names).
